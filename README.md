The purpose of this project was to create a random password base on the users input.

The users input options were:
- How long should the password length be (8-128)
- Should the password contain uppercase letters
- Should the password contain lowercase letters
- Should the password contain nubers
- Should the password contain special characters.

Based off the users choices, the password generator will generate a string at random at the length they choose.
